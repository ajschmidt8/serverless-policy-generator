# Serverless Policy Generator

[The generator](http://sls.ajschmidt.com/) will create an IAM Policy with the minimum required permissions for deploying, updating, and deleting a Lambda function with an API Gateway endpoint via the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/). It combines rules from Dan Crumb's _[generator-serverless-policy](https://github.com/dancrumb/generator-serverless-policy)_ project and [a chapter from serverless-stack.com](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/customize-the-serverless-iam-policy.html). [This Serverless article](https://www.serverless.com/blog/abcs-of-iam-permissions) was also referenced.
